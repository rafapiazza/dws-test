# dws-test
 
Project for backend interview for DWS

Requisites:

Java 17
Redis
Mongodb
I recommend commenting out the @cacheable lines of AlbumServiceImpl.java, ArtistServiceImpl.java and TrackServiceImpl.java services to debug locally

The engine controller it's just to start mongodb with all the info from the dws api
